Support layer for older versions of GCC as Yocto moves forward and deprecates 
earlier versions.  Currently supports GCC 7.x for Warrior (2.7) of Yocto and
beyond.  Needed for support of CUDA 10 if you're not using clang/LLVM of 9.0 
or later.  Also needed for some SoC's if you're not using Linaro GCC as well.
